The syncthing binary will be added here by the download_latest script. The
upstream tarball will be found in the source/ subdirectory of the root, along
with a signed hash from the maintainers.

As this is an unconfined application, no further binaries such as 'mkdir' or
'sed' are needed in this directory.
